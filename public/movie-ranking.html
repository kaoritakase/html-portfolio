<h1>Kaori's Top Anime Movies</h1>
<h2>My top 5 anime movies.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>
  A classic. I have watched it so many times since I was little! I love how you
  can feel Japanese culture through the movie, and also Chihiro's journey to
  become stronger, resulting in her rescuing her parents.
</p>
<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>
  As with many other Ghibli movies, I love how they can portray ugly and
  beautiful together. A "normal" girl helping a "strong" magician! Loved it.
</p>
<h3>Your Name</h3>
<p>
  The artwork and animation are beautiful! And the story is cute and intriguing.
</p>
<h3>Princess Mononoke</h3>
<p>
  As a Ghibli fan, I love strong female characters and this movie portrays that
  very well. Plus the Japanese historical influence that it has is portrayed
  amazingly.
</p>
<h3>My Neighbor Totoro</h3>
<p>
  Watched it countless times, the story is cute but dark. This movie made me a
  Ghibli fan.
